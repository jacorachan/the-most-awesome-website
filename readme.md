# The most Awesome Webpage template

This is just a demo for the Most Awesome Webpage registration form. The main idea is to create a form that will be easy, fast and get the more signups as possible.

For sure, as any good live product, this should be taken with caution, as noone, even "the experts" knows what's really the best formula for a particular project. So some iterations and user tests should be acomplished once live in order to find what works better for our users. 37Signals blog has some great articles and ideas about this continue & improving iteration once live process:

Even this "live" feedback and usability tests are necesary, the aim of this prototype is to make a general purpose sign up form, without knowing anything about our potential users, without even know the product or service provided. So this prototype will just use some of the front-end best practices and usability tips that I have been learnd through all this years.
